# ThinkTank

Hello! This is my private repository for trying new ideas :) 

This project is a webapp that can predict the probability that the user has a LinkedIn profile. This is achieved by running ML algorithms in Python that take the user inputs and score them against historical LinkedIn demographic (public) data. 

Thanks for stopping by. All feedback is appreciated.
